        <h1>Shakespeare's Sonnet #18<br></h1>
        <br>
        This is one of the most famous of the sonnets. It is referenced in the film
        Dead Poets Society and gave names<br>
        to the band The Darling Buds and the book and television series The Darling
        Buds of May. Read it and weep!<br>
        <br>
        
        <div align="center">&#x2022;Shall I compare thee to summer's day?<br>
                &#x2022;Thou art more lovely and more temperate:<br>
                &#x2022;Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,<br>
                &#x2022;And summer's lease hath all too short a date:<br>
                &#x2022;Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,<br>
                &#x2022;And often is his gold complexion dimm'd, <br>
                &#x2022;And every fair from fair sometime declines,<br>
                &#x2022;By chance, or nature's changing course untrimm'd:<br>
                &#x2022;But thy eternal summer shall not fade,<br>
                &#x2022;Nor lose possession of that fait thou ow'st,<br>
                &#x2022;Nor shall death brag thou wander'st in his shade,<br>
                &#x2022;When in eternal lines to time thou grow'st,<br>
                &#x2022;So long as men can breathe, or eyes can see,<br>
                &#x2022;So long lives this, and this gives life to thee.<br>
